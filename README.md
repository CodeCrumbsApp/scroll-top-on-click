# scroll-top-on-click

Choose a set of elements that will trigger a scroll action (scroll to the top) on the page itself, as well as any elements you choose that have the CSS property `overflow` set to `scroll`.

### Why might this be useful?

A common example is pagination controls at the bottom of a long list. Sometimes the pagination might not automatically scroll the user back to the top of the list once the page has changed, which can be frustrating for the user. This plugin allows you to set up a scroll-to-top action when the user clicks on the pagination controls.

See the demo on the CodeCrumbs page to see how this crumb works.
